# MSE 342 - Project template (based on the repository of MSE 245 - Project Deliverable 2)


## Development Tips:
- Use CodeSpaces for this project.
- In VSCode terminal on CodeSpaces start a new branch:
```git checkout -b your-branch-name```
- As you code, push daily changes to your GitHub repo's `d2` branch:
```
git add .
git commit -m "done feature xyz"
git push origin your-branch-name
```


### Setting up access to the database from Codespaces

Watch the video on how to set up connection to the database from Codespaces: https://vimeo.com/974744158/db6098a69b?share=copy

Follow the instructions and ensure that you are able to connect to the database from Codespaces.
   
Steps:

   1. Download the Private Key file `student_ed25519` from Learn (located under Contents > General lab resources) to your own computer. 
   
   2. Open GitHub in the browser. Go to Settings > Codespaces. Click on `New Secret` button. Type the word `STUDENT` in the `Name` field, and paste the content of the Private Key file in the `Value` field. In the `Repository Access` drop-down menu, select the name of your Lab 9 repository. Click `Add Secret` button. 
   
   3. Start CodeSpaces. In the Terminal on Codespaces, copy and paste the following:

   ```
   echo "${STUDENT}"
   ```
   
   If your setup has been correct so far, this will print the content of your private key to the terminal. Verify that it is displayed.

   4. Next, copy and paste the following:

   ```
   eval `ssh-agent`
   ```

   You should see the response like this: `Agent pid 28558`

   5. Next, copy and paste the following:

   ```
   ssh-add - <<< "${STUDENT}"
   ```

   You should see the following response: `Identity added: (stdin) (student@mse-msci-245)`


   6. Next, copy and paste the following. Make sure that you change `<your-user-name>` to your actual UW username (without the angle brackets). 
   
   ```
	ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -L 3306:localhost:3306 <your-user-name>@mse-msci-245.uwaterloo.ca
   ```

   You should see the prompt change to a line like this:

   ![image](/img/Lab9-img1.png)

   This means that you have successfully logged in to the remote server hosting the database. 
   
   Important: Do not close this terminal window!

   7. Start a new terminal in Codespaces by clicking on the following icon in the top-right corner of the terminal:
![image](/img/Lab9-img2.png)
   8. In the second terminal, type `yarn dev` to start the app on port 3000.

   9. In the root project directory, edit `config.js`, by adding your UW username on Lines 3 and on line 6. This will let you access the MySQL database named as `<your-username>` from NodeJS.
